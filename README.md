# Group Repository

This will be your group repository. Please use this to manage the code your group is working on. When your project is complete you can also submit your poster and project report to this repository also.

## Group Project

### What is the Project?

Your project should demonstrate your level of mastery over the course material. It its your chance to show the world what you have learned in the course and that you are capable of acquiring new programming skills independently.

For your project you will write a program and then demonstrate it during our class Demo Day.
What you decide to do for the final project is up to you, but you should run your idea by your instructors before you start work.

You should build something of interest to you which solves an actual problem. We encourage you to think big and follow your passion.

You are expected to work in groups of 2-3 people. Each person on the team should contribute equally.

The scope/size of your project should be at minimum the equivalent of about 4 homework assignments, in groups of 3 that would be 6.

As a guideline a quality project will take 20 hours of work per student in the group.

### Project Proposal

The project proposal is a 2 to 3 page document laying out the idea for your project. It should include: - An analysis of the problem - A proposed solution to the problem and how your application will acheive that. - Basic user flow and interaction with the application, this should include things like what kind of user interface will you be using, etc. - Reaseach on where data that the application requires will be obtained (Web api, database, other sources etc). - Project proposals need to be approved by the instructor.

### What is Demo Day?

Students demonstrate their projects on Demo Day. It’s like a career fair, science fair, or poster session. It’s an open forum where guests will walk around and ask you to demonstrate and explain your project.
Demo Day is held during our final exam block. It is your opportunity to showcase your project to your instructors as well as other people in the campus community.

### Demo Day Poster

You demo day poster is a visual explanation of your project.
It should capture the attention of the audience and draw them in to your demonstration.
Your poster should be 24” x 36”. It can be printed in the iSchool or the Library.
It should be attached to cardboard so it can stand up without having to be taped to a wall.
Handing it In

You are expected to submit all artifacts associated with your project. This includes - Your source code and any additional information required to execute your code after demo day. 
- A digital version of your poster from demo day. 
- A written explanation of “who did what” on your project. 
- A written explanation of how your code works.

### Grading Criteria

Your project is graded out of 120 points based on the following criteria. For each criteria we will issue a sliding scale of points based on whether you:

definitely met the criteria, somewhat met the criteria, or not at all. Did not meed the criteria

#### 1: The Project:

- Does it have a useful purpose / solve an actual problem?
- Is it ambitious? Complex in scope?
- Was the idea run by instructors first?

#### 2: Demo Day:

- Is your demonstration easy to understand (Can we understand your project)?
- Is your presentation organized (Code works/demonstrates well)?

#### 3: Your Demo Day Poster:

- Is your poster a visual representation of your project?
- Does it meet the poster criteria?

#### 4: Your Code:

- Does it execute and function as designed?
- Is it easy to read and understand? (modularized into functions, variables aptly named)
- Does it handle errors (bad input, broken API’s, etc…) ?
- Does it demonstrate you’ve mastered the course material?
- Does it demonstrate you’ve acquired new skills independently (a package, library, or API we did not teach or help you with)?

#### 5: Your explanation:

- Did you include a written explanation of who did what on your project?
- Does your code explanation reflect the actual code you wrote?

#### 6: Collaboration:

- Did you work in a group of 2 or 3, demonstrating you can collaborate?
- Did you contribute to all aspects of the project (code, poster, demo)?


**NOTE: If just ONE of these criteria is not at all the highest grade on the project is 105/120.**
