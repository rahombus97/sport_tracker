# SportTracker

A social media analyzer for college sports departments to see if they are engaging their fans on college days and to see the difference in their school's social media engagement on games that they won versus days that they lost. Built using the Python Flask framework and the JavaScript Library "Chart.js". Check it out!

# How to run

If you have Flask already installed on your computer, then you will need to run the Flask commands to start up any application using the 'app.py' file in the 'sport_tracker' directory.
